desc:
  - Open the developer tools, and view the Network tab
  - Run the report (1)
  - The moment the detail query dialog shows up, press cancel (while it says "Queuing up agent task")
    - This will attempt to abort the AJAX request that triggers the agent command
    - This will ALSO ensure that if the AJAX completes, we'll subsequently send an action=cancel
  - Expected -> request is cancelled, a request is made to /Commands with action=cancel, and no more polls to /Commands are made
  - Run the report (2)
  - Once the detail query dialog shows up, wait until is says "Waiting for task to complete on agent", then press cancel
  - Expected -> request is cancelled, a request is made to /Commands with action=cancel, and no more polls to /Commands are made
  - Run the report (3)
  - Then click on another page in the app sidebar
  - Expected -> request is cancelled, a request is made to /Commands with action=cancel, and no more polls to /Commands are made
  - Open up Fiddler, and capture traffic for your browser process
  - Run the report (4)
  - Close the browser tab
  - Expected -> request is cancelled, a request is made to /Commands with action=cancel (can only be verified via Fiddler)
